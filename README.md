# CmdMandelbrot
Plot the Mandelbrot Set only with your command line! (And a bit of python)

## Setup
Install the needed libraries with `pip install -r requirements.txt` and you're good to go! 

Note: On Windows you may need to do `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt` or `py3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage
Run it as a normal python project. You can control the camera with the following keys:

### Keys
* **Arrows**: move up, down, left and right
* **F1**: zoom out
